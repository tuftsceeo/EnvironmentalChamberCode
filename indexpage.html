<p style= "font-size:125%;"><center>    This website is being used as part of the Brass Acid Bleed Project. <br>
There are a couple pages that display information about the conditions of  <br>
the environmental chamber, which contains samples of brass subject to      <br>
specified heat and humidity conditions. Further improvements to this site  <br>
include pushing it from a local web serve to a globally accessed website,  <br>
allowing the data to be updated live and displayed live, and controlling   <br>
the conditions of the chamber from user input. The following pages are     <br>
extensions to the current website.                                         <br></center></p>
